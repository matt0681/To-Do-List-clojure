# to-do-list-clojure

A simple To-Do List application I created in clojure. I used this program as a learning experience in clojure. Currently you can add dates and to-do entries via the gui window.
Running underneath the gui is a clojure file which stores all the to-do entries. The gui simply fetches and stores entries to and from this file.

## Usage

core.clj is the file that runs entire application. Run (main) to start application.
